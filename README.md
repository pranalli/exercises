###### Programming Exercises

This is simply a collection of exercises I have done for fun, education and skill refinement.  They were all done by me,
me without looking up any answers, unless noted.  They were completed as-if I was in a SWE interview and therefore are 
not perfect or overly revised/designed -- they are relatively raw, and a reflection of my own programming style. 

I am currently in search of a SWE position at a company whose business I can truly standby and feel good about.  At this 
stage of my career, that means more to me than anything.  To discuss employment opportunities, please contact me via
